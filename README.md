# Introduction
TervurenPoint is a personal project where im working on during my free time. It is an Android app where people could find important information about the City of Tervuren. At the moment it consists of 3 different tools: LocalPoint, RecyclePoint, ParkPoint. Each designed to help visitors find the best places/spots to visit during there stay in Tervuren.

## LocalPoint
This part of the app will consists of a List of all the local shops/restaurants available in Tervuren. Locals can promote their shop on it and provide extra details about availabilities, menu's etc. It consists of more personal way of promoting your shop then by using Google Reviews.

## ParkPoint
Tervuren has the very well known "Park van Tervuren/ Warande van Tervuren" which is a public parc around the "Royal Museum for Central Africa" which has a large amount of walking routes. During the walking routes you can find some intersting boards explaining the history of Tervuren. With ParkPoint I decided to implement all the "ParkPoint" with important architecture of the parc for visitors to find the perfect walking route during their stay in the parc.

## RecyclePoint
This is an extra feature, where im working on. I have the intention to implement all recycle spots in Tervuren as of a way to keep this Beautifull city clean.
